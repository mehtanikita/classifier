India has one of the lowest and \u0093most competitive\u0094 airfares in the world despite high cost of planes and fuel, Union Minister Jayant Sinha said on Wednesday. \u0093These are the two most important costs for an airline. Our taxes are also quite high,\u0094 said the Minister of State for Civil Aviation.\u0093But when you look at pricing in India, as far as Indian airlines are concerned, I can assure you that we are among the lowest and most competitive air fares in the world,\u0094 he added.In efforts to make air travel more affordable as well as connect unserved and under-served airports, the government has come out with the regional connectivity scheme.Under the scheme \u0097 UDAN (Ude Desh Ka Aam Naagrik) \u0096fares are capped at Rs 2,500 for one-hour flights.\u0093Our effort is to provide air services at an affordable cost and the regional connectivity scheme UDAN is aimed at that only,\u0094 Sinha said.At an event organised by All India Management Association (AIMA), Sinha said the country\u0092s economy is delivering high quality products and services at very affordable prices for the consumers.\u0093We are frugal economy because we are poor country\u0085 So we have to deliver product and services at price points which are affordable. This forces us to really think about affordability and cost management at all the time,\u0094 he noted.In terms of purchasing power parity, India\u0092s GDP is around USD 8 trillion while it is about USD 18 trillion for both the US and China.According to Sinha, India is growing at 7-8 per cent while the US is expanding at 2.5 per cent and in the case of China the growth rate is pegged at 6 per cent.\u0093It effectively means that the contribution that the Indian economy is going to make in the next decade in terms of relative contribution of growth rate of the US economy, is 180 per cent,\u0094 he noted.Further, he said that India\u0092s contribution to global GDP growth in PPP terms in the next decade would be almost twice what the US is going to add.\u0093\u0085it is 60 per cent of China, which is still going to be larger. But we are 60 per cent of China, which is a much larger piece of USD 18 trillion,\u0094 he added.
