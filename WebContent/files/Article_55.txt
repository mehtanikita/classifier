Washington D.C. [USA], Apr 13 (ANI): A team of researchers has brought a cure for Parkinson's disease closer to reality.\r\n\r\nPalmitoylethanolamide, an endogenous fatty acid amide signalling molecule well-known for its ability to promote the resolution of neuroinflammation and exert neuroprotection, has shown potential therapeutic action in such animal models.\r\n\r\nThe research showed that ultra-micronized palmitoylethanolamide (um-PEA), slows down disease progression and disability when used as add-on therapy in advanced PD patients.\r\n\r\n30 patients with diagnosed PD (mean age of 73) receiving L-DOPA daily and other PD medications in some cases were assessed monthly over 3 consecutive months. Thereafter, um-PEA (Normast, a food for special medical purposes) was given at 1200 mg daily for 3 months, followed by 600 mg/day for up to 12 months.\r\n\r\nThe MDS-UPDRS questionnaire was used to assess motor and non-motor symptoms. Patients underwent clinical assessment at months 1, 3, 6 and 12. PD medications were maintained during the period of um-PEA treatment.\r\n\r\nThe um-PEA add-on therapy to L-DOPA led a significant and progressive reduction of total score in Non-Motor Aspects of Experiences of Daily Living, decreasing from 9.7 \u00B1 1.18 at baseline to 4.5 \u00B1 0.69 at month 12.\r\n\r\nMoreover, one year um-PEA adjuvant therapy brought about a significant and progressive reduction in the average Motor Aspects of Experiences of Daily Living total score, from 12.7 \u00B1 1.37 at baseline to 7.6 \u00B1 1.06 at month 12.\r\n\r\nIn addition, average total motor complication score diminished from 8.8 \u00B1 0.8 at baseline to 4.2 \u00B1 0.48 after 12 months of um-PEA adjuvant therapy.\r\n\r\nThe addition of um-PEA treatment also induced a significant and progressive reduction of motor complications that went from 8.8 \u00B1 0.8 at baseline to 4.2 \u00B1 0.48 at the end of um-PEA therapy.\r\n\r\nNone of the participants reported side effects attributable to um-PEA.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, um-PEA represents a safe and efficacious adjuvant treatment in patients with advanced PD receiving L-DOPA therapy, by providing clinically meaningful improvements in non-motor and motor aspects of daily living, as well as motor symptoms and motor complications of the disease. Moreover, our findings demonstrate the translatability of um-PEA action in PD from rodent to man.\r\n\r\nThe study is CNS & Neurological Disorders - Drug Targets. (ANI)
