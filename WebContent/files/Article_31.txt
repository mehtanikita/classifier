Identifying executive function (EF) skills among the patchwork of regulation-related buzz words like grit, self-control, and behavioral regulation is important \u0097 but it\u0092s only one of several distinctions needed to identify the core skills for success.\r\n\r\nA second grade teacher striving for a calmer classroom needs to understand how the competencies her students gained in preschool have prepared them for new skills. A policymaker deciding which skills schools should emphasize needs to be able to assess relevant research findings. A researcher looking to boost reading comprehension needs to distinguish the skills necessary for academic success from the ones that lead to social awareness.\r\n\r\nAcknowledging these various needs, a new report from researchers at the Harvard Graduate School of Education describes fundamental nonacademic skills, shows how they vary, and advises education stakeholders about how to think about these skills in their individual practices. \r\n\r\nHOW CORE SKILLS VARY \r\nSkills vary by complexity. Mastering \u0093simple skills,\u0094 which are core competencies that can\u0092t be broken down into smaller components, can prepare children to grasp more \u0093complex skills.\u0094 For example, self-control is a complex skill requiring attention and working memory, which are both simple skills.\r\nUnderstanding how skills are scaffolded in this manner can:\r\n\r\nHelp teachers map out learning trajectories for students and identify which simple skills they need to master first\r\nHelp policymakers recognize the fundamental nonacademic skills children need for success throughout their lives\r\nChildren acquire certain skills at specific developmental stages. For example, children should begin developing working memory and behavioral regulation in preschool and kindergarten, laying the foundation for more sophisticated planning and problem-solving skills later in elementary school.\r\nUnderstanding how children learn at different ages can:\r\n\r\nHelp program developers ensure that they are targeting and measuring developmentally appropriate skills\r\nHelp program evaluators accurately decide whether a curriculum is building core skills\r\nHelp policymakers recognize which skills children need to learn at specific stages of their education\r\nDifferent skills exist in different developmental domains: the cognitive domain, social domain, or emotional domain. Proficiency in different domains leads to different outcomes. For example, a child who has strong skills in the cognitive domain may perform well on math assessments, whereas a child with strong skills in the social or emotional domains may excel at perspective-taking or have lessened anxiety.\r\nUnderstanding how different skills have different outcomes can:\r\n\r\nHelp teachers and caregivers build children\u0092s competencies in areas where they most need assistance\r\nHelp program developers hone in on skills related to the outcomes they want to see  \r\nHelp program evaluators assess whether a program is effective at connecting skills to results\r\nDifferent measurement strategies have different shortcomings and benefits. There are two main ways to evaluate a child\u0092s skills: direct assessments and observational reports by teachers and parents. Direct assessments are more objective, but not always reflective of real-life scenarios; reports by teachers and parents are more subjective, but they do record real situations. Often, EF skills are measured through direct cognitive assessments, and broader regulation-related skills are measured in reports of how children act in stressful situations\r\nUnderstanding the ways skills are measured can:\r\n\r\nHelp teachers comprehend assessments of their students\u0092 skills\r\nHelp program developers choose the best method to evaluate results in their program or curriculum\r\nHelp evaluators evaluate how well a program has done in meeting its goals.
