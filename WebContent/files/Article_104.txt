One student was bullied because her parents were supporters of candidate Trump. Another student expressed strong and divisive anti-immigration views in a class with several immigrant students. A group of teachers differed over whether a proposed Muslim registry was ripe for debate at school \u2014 or was just wrong, too far outside the bounds.\r\n\r\nThese are the kinds of problems \u2014 murky, time-sensitive, and without clear roadmaps \u2014 that educators, school leaders, and parents know well, says Professor Meira Levinson, a former teacher who now studies ethical dilemmas in the classroom. In a frank conversation recorded for the Harvard EdCast, Levinson and two fellow researchers, doctoral candidates Laura Burgos and Jacob Fay, describe the complexities teachers routinely navigate, often alone, and especially in today's divisive political and cultural climate.\r\n\r\nTo encourage a shared conversation about these tricky moments, Levinson and her team have developed three case studies \u2014 responding to contemporary scenarios \u2014 for teachers, school leaders, and parents. The cases center on three questions: whether and how to accommodate divisive but politically endorsed speech, how to handle student protests in politically complex times, and how to manage controversy and critical thinking in your classroom. As they explore the nuances, educators and parents can also explore their own ethical responses and obligations.
