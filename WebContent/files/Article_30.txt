With an unsettling year drawing to a close, many educators are increasingly aware of race: how it impacts student achievement and how it obstructs connections between people. But as we hope for a new year filled with equity and kindness in schools and beyond, research offers some encouraging insights.\r\n\r\nConfronting racial tensions, biases, and microaggressions can have powerful effects. But schools may also benefit from widening the lens. Behavioral psychologist Todd Pittinsky has found that when white teachers encourage and model overtly welcoming interactions between students of different races, ethnicities, genders, and abilities, student achievement increases.\r\n\r\nThese \u0093microaffirmations,\u0094 as Pittinsky calls them, can be transformative \u0097 not only for academic work, but for broader school climate and even for life outcomes.THE RESEARCH\r\nIn a recent study, Pittinsky, who teaches at the Harvard Graduate School of Education, tested whether positive attitudes of predominantly white teachers could augment the learning outcomes of mostly minority students. The results suggest that simply being welcoming and inclusive can help students not only feel comfortable in school, but also grow academically.\r\n\r\nThe study looked at more than 1,200 teachers in predominantly minority schools in 14 states across the country. Of them, 80 percent were white and the rest nearly all Latino or African American.\r\n\r\nIt examined two characteristics of welcoming interactions: what Pittinsky calls \u0093empathic joy,\u0094 or the happiness that comes from taking the perspective of another person, and \u0093allophilia,\u0094 a term he coined as an antonym to prejudice, meaning \u0093love or like of the other.\u0094\r\n\r\nTo determine teachers\u0092 levels of empathy and allophilia, the researchers asked them to rate their agreement to statements such as \u0093When my students celebrate things, I am happy for them\u0094 and \u0093In general, I have positive attitudes about my students.\u0094 The researchers then measured these scores alongside assessments of the teachers\u0092 positive engagement with their students, and against end-of-year tests measuring students\u0092 academic growth.\r\n\r\nThe results? A chain of good effects.\r\n\r\nTeachers\u0092 empathic joy was associated with allophilia. Allophilia, in turn, was associated with positive engagements between students and teachers, which were then associated with greater student learning. The research suggests that these positive interactions can make students more optimistic at school and more committed to continuing their education.\r\n\r\nMICROAFFIRMATIONS IN THE CLASSROOM\r\nMany teachers already recognize and promote positive interactions \u0097 microaffirmations \u0097 in their classrooms, though perhaps without fully realizing its measurable impact. In a recent Phi Delta Kappan article, Pittinsky gives several examples:\r\n\r\nNodding and making eye contact with students while they\u0092re talking\r\nMaking sure to call on students of different races and genders equally\r\nReferring to every student by his or her name\r\nUsing inclusive language \u0097 for instance, talk about \u0093families\u0094 instead of \u0093parents\u0094\r\nOpenly giving praise for a wide-range of actions, from answering a question right to sitting still during a lesson\r\nStaying enthusiastic when interacting with students\r\n\u0093Focusing on microaffirmations can create a virtuous cycle,\u0094 writes Pittinsky. \u0093Over time, they can redefine the normative behavior in a classroom \u0097 or in a school \u0097 not only to avoid exclusion and insult, but also to embrace inclusion and affirmation.\u0094\r\n\r\nSMALL BEHAVIORS \u0097 BIG IMPACT\r\nThis study also suggests that education could benefit from a more comprehensive focus on how behaviors both big and small impact students and schools. Teachers, school leaders, and researchers could look at how a wide-range of microbehaviors impact students, and the various forms these small actions can take.\r\n\r\n\u0093Instead of narrowly focusing on slights and insults,\u0094 Pittinsky writes, \u0093we should be looking at the whole spectrum of microbehaviors and finding ways to promote the ones that can help us best educate diverse K-12 students.\u0094 And there\u0092s no reason for educators and researchers to stop with the latest findings. It\u0092s possible, says Pittinsky, that there is more good news to be discovered about microaffirmations, and more to learn in general about how small behaviors affect student achievement.\r\n\r\nREIMAGINING EMPATHY\r\nFinally, this study reimagines empathy, deliberately putting it in a new light. We tend to focus on \u0093empathic sorrow,\u0094 or the negative feelings that come along with recognizing the pain or misfortune of someone else. But Pittinsky\u0092s work shows that empathic joy is also a powerful tool in aligning disparate groups of people and in creating feelings of success. \u0093Interestingly,\u0094 he notes, \u0093in other research on empathic joy, we observed an important trend: The teachers who felt the most empathic joy were the ones who were reporting lower levels of burnout.\u0094\r\n\r\nThis new emphasis on empathic joy makes it possible for schools to use empathy not only to boost student achievement, but also to reframe lessons in history and civics on the importance of kindness and mutual understanding in fostering constructive solutions.
