Four members of a family, including two women, were on Wednesday hacked to death allegedly by the husband of a 40-year-old woman, who was murdered earlier in a village under Potka police station area of East Singhbum (Jamshedpur) district.\r\nThe accused has been arrested. The police said that the accused carried out the killings with an intention to avenge the murder of his wife, who was killed by the elder brother of victims\u0092 family following allegations of witch-craft a few days ago.\r\n\u0093The incident occurred in Chattani Tola of Patthar Bhanga village in Potka around 6 a.m. Those who died were identified as Thapa Tudu (35), his brother Ramesh Tudu (28), Ramesh\u0092 wife Malti Tudu (22) and Ramesh\u0092 sister Sonia Tudu (18). Ramesh and Thapa used to work as drivers for private individuals. The accused has been identified as Basko Tudu (45). Basko would earn his livelihood by picking up odd jobs in the village. He has been arrested,\u0094 said Incharge (Potka) Arvind Kumar Yadav.\r\nHe added that the accused carried out the murders to take revenge of killing of his wife, Bali Tudu (40), on January 15, by Shyam Tudu alias Bhairo, the elder brother of Thapa. Shyam had already been arrested.\r\nSub-Divisional Police Officer (Musabani) Ajit Kumar Vimal said: \u0093Basko has told us that, following the murder of his wife, he had begun carrying an axe fearing for life. He had gone to answer nature\u0092s call, where he spotted Thapa, also relieving himself. He claims that Thapa passed some comments on him, which enraged him. He attacked Thapa and killed him on the spot.\u0094\r\nVimal added that the surge of anger did not subside and Basko went to their home. \u0093As soon as Ramesh opened the door, he attacked him. He was angry over the murder of his wife on the day of a festival. Malti and Sonia began shouting for help and tried to close the door. But Basko broke through it and then hacked the two women also,\u0094 said the officer.\r\n\u0093This case is directly related to the murder that had taken place on January 15 in the same area. Basko\u0092s wife Bali Tudu (40) was murdered by Shyam Tudu alias Bhairo on January 15. Shyam was arrested in that case and sent to jail. But Basko was nursing a grudge against the family,\u0094 said Vimal.\r\nInitial investigations revealed that Basko and Shyam Tudu had a history of litigation over property. Shyam, in a bid to get rid of the opposite party, murdered Bali while levying allegations that she was involved in witch-craft. \u0093Our investigations indicate that the allegation of witch-craft was just a created excuse and the backdrop of the dispute was litigation over property,\u0094 said Vimal.
