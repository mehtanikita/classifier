Nanded (Maharashtra) [India], Apr. 14 (ANI): Taking a bizarre take on farmers' suicide, independent MLA from Maharashtra Bacchu Kadu sparked controversy by dragging Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Lok Sabha MP Hema Malini into the row.\r\nDenying the reasoning of alcoholism behind farmers' suicide, Kadu said Hema Malini drinks everyday but she does not commit suicide.\r\n\r\n\"Hema Malini drinks everyday, but does she commit suicide?\" Kadu said while addressing a press conference here.\r\n\r\nContinuing the same tone, Kadu further said that even the notion that farmers commit suicide due to burden of excess expenditure in marriage is also incorrect.\r\n\r\nExplaining the same, the MLA further delved into a bizarre explanation saying that should they wait and see if Union Minister Nitin Gadkari commits suicide after spending Rs. 4 crore on his son's wedding.\r\n\r\n\"All these reasons are nonsensical. Gadkari spent Rs. four crore in his son's wedding. So should we now wait for him to commit suicide?\" he said.\r\n\r\nKadu further said that the real cause behind these suicides is lack of money.\r\n\r\n\"Professor Swamninathan always said that farmers' produce is increasing but not their income,\" he said.\r\n\r\nExpressing displeasure over farmers' suicide, the Supreme Court on Thursday ordered the Tamil Nadu Government to file a detailed reply in the farmers' suicide issue in two weeks.\r\n\r\nThe apex court lashed out at the government for not taking enough measures to prevent the farmers' suicides in the state.\r\n\r\nAn apex court headed by Justice Dipak Mishra said, \"It is very painful to hear it that farmers are committing suicide and the state government is not taking enough steps.\"\r\n\r\nAn NGO had moved the apex court, pointing to the increasing cases of farmers' suicides.(ANI)
