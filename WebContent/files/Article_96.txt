Son Heung-min grabbed a hat trick as he seamlessly filled the void left by Harry Kane\u0092s injury-enforced early departure, powering Tottenham into the FA Cup semifinals with a 6-0 rout of third-tier Millwall on Sunday.The South Korean made it six goals in four FA Cup games this season and he even set up fellow forward Vincent Janssen to end a seven-month wait for a goal from open play since joining Tottenham.Christian Eriksen, who replaced Kane after 10 minutes, provided the cross for Son\u0092s third after scoring the opener and also set up Dele Alli\u0092s second-half strike.But the joy at sealing Tottenham\u0092s trip to the semifinals for the first time in five years was tempered by Kane\u0092s ankle injury. Tottenham\u0092s top scorer missed 10 games after twisting the same right ankle in September and manager Mauricio Pochettino fears the worst again after he left in a protective boot.\u0093We cannot cry, we have to try to be positive,\u0094 Pochettino said. \u0093We have enough players to replace him.\u0094Son can never be sure of a starting spot but he has netted 13 goals this season.\u0093Son can play like a striker,\u0094 Pochettino said. \u0093If you remember one of our best performances was a game against Manchester City here and he was the striker here when Harry was injured (and set up Alli\u0092s goal).\u0093We have different possibilities and different formations. Of course I am sad about Harry\u0092s injury but now I try to find solutions and try to find which is the best player to replace him.\u0094Son\u0092s first goal came after initially struggling to control a pass but he recovered, cutting inside defender Jake Cooper and curling a shot into the far corner five minutes before halftime. Son doubled his tally nine minutes into the second half, getting ahead of Cooper again to latch onto Kieran Trippier\u0092s high pass from the halfway line and volleying into the net. The third in stoppage time was helped into the net by goalkeeper Tom King who let Son\u0092s strike slip through his legs as he fumbled the save.Son was also the target of abuse from some Millwall fans when he touched the ball in the first half at White Hart Lane, with chants of \u0093DVD\u0094 and \u0093selling three for a fiver\u0094 aimed at him. Millwall manager Neil Harris was asked in the post-match news conference about such chants being racially offensive Asian stereotypes.\u0093I\u0092m sure it will be investigated and left to the authorities,\u0094 Harris said. \u0093We want people dealt with harshly. \u0085 It\u0092s wrong in football and wrong in society.\u0094Herman Ouseley, the Millwall-supporting chairman of anti-racism group Kick It Out, was unaware of the offensive interpretation of the \u0093DVD\u0094-related chants.\u0093If complaints are made they will have to be looked at to see if they have any validity to see if it stirs up racial hatred,\u0094 Ouseley told The Associated Press.There was a heavy police presence outside the ground, with some confrontations between rival fans before and after the game. Inside, though, there was no disorder at what could be the last FA Cup game at White Hart Lane.The semifinal will see the 1991 FA Cup winners visit their second home at Wembley. Tottenham\u0092s Champions League and Europa League games were played at English soccer\u0092s national stadium this season and it is set to play every fixture there next season as White Hart Lane is demolished to make way for a new stadium.Tottenham joins north London rival Arsenal and Manchester City in a strong semifinal lineup that will be completed after Chelsea hosts Manchester United on Monday.
