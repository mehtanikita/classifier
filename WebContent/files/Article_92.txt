The topic regarding the nature of the pitch for the third Test between India and Australia in Ranchi has been selling like hot cakes. Speculations are rife that it might be another rank-turner like Pune and seemingly this is what has led former Australian fast-bowler Merv Hughes to call for uncapped leg-spinner Mitch Swepson\u0092s selection in the side.Speaking to a Melbourne radio station Hughes said,\u0094You\u0092ve got Swepson sitting on the sidelines. It\u0092d be a hell of a gamble (to pick him) but it might be a gamble worth taking. If I\u0092m hearing (correctly) about what the wicket is like (in Ranchi), it\u0092ll be like that first Test wicket in Pune. You could almost go with three spinners.\u0094However, Hughes was a bit skeptical about whether Australia would field three spinners. \u0093That goes against everything in the Australian psyche. It\u0092s in our Australian psyche (to select) two fast-bowlers, two spinners and a batting allrounder. They could (bring in) the leg-spinner and have Hazlewood and Stoinis (as the two seamers), if it\u0092s a wicket like that first-Test wicket where they were talking about playing three spinners.\u0094 Hughes observed.23-year-old Swepson was selected over Adam Zampa for his ability to spin the ball further than the latter. Swepson also has an impressive first-class record of 41 wickets at 32.82 from 14 matches as well.Meanwhile, former Australia captain Steve Waugh also said last month that Swepson could prove to be a decisive factor for the kangaroos. \u0093There\u0092s an opportunity there \u0085 India haven\u0092t seen him and I think that surprise element could be very handy. I think the selectors and (captain Steve) Smith have to work out whether his temperament is up to it. His biggest issue would be handling that pressure in a big situation with the crowd making a lot of noise. Can he remain calm and composed\u0094, Waugh said.
