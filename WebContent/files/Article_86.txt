A lot of badminton players can get you rooting for them to win \u0096 get you to snarl, scowl, scream and vicariously live out their aggression. The smash \u0096 finished with a pumped fist \u0096 can get you glowering at their opponent on TV screens or at Gachibowli or Siri Fort. Two women, though, evoked something else when watching Sunday\u0092s All England final: Tai Tzu Ying and Ratchanok Intanon made you fervently wish that the final went to a decider \u0096 no matter who won. It wasn\u0092t the pumped fists but creative wrists that left you wishing for more magic.Belligerence has its admirers \u0096 the Olympics final between PV Sindhu and Carolina Marin found itself a record audience. But the All England \u0096 much lower in stakes and the strain it can put on everyone \u0096 proved less hostile and more wholesome badminton. Two of the world\u0092s most talented stroke-makers, Tai Tzu of Chinese Taipei and Ratchanok of Thailand, jammed together, and didn\u0092t disappoint a packed house after organisers turned women\u0092s singles into the showstopper of the day \u0096 scheduling it as the finale, while even Lee Chong Wei played on a rare undercard.\r\n\r\nWhen Ratchanok deftly slowed down a rally \u0096 like you would control the pulse with deep breaths \u0096 getting the shuttle to do exactly what she needed, with not a wand but a racquet, the demand for a decider grew in decibels. Badminton routinely gets its winners and losers, but this last weekend, the sport was unfurling an entire tapestry of deception. Tai Tzu was a deserving 21-14, 22-20 winner, but only because she out-dazzled arguably the most talented shuttler of the last decade.Tai Tzu is instinctive, Ratchanok not as bold, but both can give the impression of holding the shuttle mid-air while waiting for the opponent to commit to a side to retrieve, and then hit it in the opposite direction. You don\u0092t need slow-mo cameras, these two are special effects unto themselves. It also involves athleticism in anticipating where the shuttle will come, to go park yourself there and call the shots \u0096 literally, so Tai Tzu is a leaner, fitter marvel than what she was at the Olympics going down to Sindhu in an early round.The two traded in deception: they played at least a dozen shots with imperceptible changes to their wrist action. Tai Tzu had crosscourts at the net (one off the backhand which will grow into a wristy monster in coming years), and half-smashes, drops and lifts \u0096 all of which you\u0092d reckon would land in one part of the court but which would head to another. Ratchanok dealt in pushes and constructing rallies where she could alternate pace and shift gears multiple times within a point. Smashes struck with power can whip up screams, but these strokes sucked in breath and made you whistle.Anticipation and flairA sight for sore, jaded eyes \u0096 after watching the eternal retrieving or power smashing like the baseline power-hitting in tennis \u0096 Tai Tzu\u0092s is a game of magnetic control on the shuttle: Easy movements, a varied repertoire of strokes to summon \u0096 an area where she puts Sindhu and Marin in shade \u0096 anticipation and flair. She and Ratchanok look for creative solutions to find gaps on courts.Men\u0092s singles has long fallen into a pattern \u0096 fast, faster to strong, strongest, Chong Wei\u0092s speed and Lin Dan\u0092s steady play making us wistful about the time when Taufik Hidayat gave into indulgent urges of that elastic backhand. Chinese southpaw Zhao Jianhua was known to jump high \u0096 and no one could tell how he would strike mid-air deceptively and where the bird would fly. In India, Nandu Natekar possessed tricks, though Suresh Goel was famed for his touch artistry. Trupti Murgunde had natural flair for deception, but little success. Chong Wei and Lin Dan and now the beastly gentle giant Chen Long used to be badminton\u0092s poster-boys, but the last two years have seen the emergence of women\u0092s singles players from at least seven countries \u0096 Taipei, Thailand, Japan, Spain, India and Korea \u0096 that pull in spectators, even as China recoup from a slide that\u0092s yielded no player of exception. 2000 Sydney women\u0092s singles champion Gong Zhichao \u0096 not too tall, built like a doll \u0096 won with this illusory flair, but the women\u0092s game too had gotten too regimented and fitness-based till Tai Tzu Ying started to win.Those who\u0092ve played alongside her in the franchise shuttle say she remains a carefree individual, and still given to laughing off the screwed-eyed aggro and intensity of modern-day champions. At 18-20 in Set 2, she chuckled. She\u0092s lost matches in the past playing this style, and though her consistency is boggling since Olympics, it remains to be seen if she can turn talent to medal in Tokyo.Tai Tzu and Ratchanok are sprinkling on badminton what Roger Federer brought to tennis. A moment of magic \u0096 never mind the competitive harshness of the context \u0096 the wins, losses.So, deception chugs along \u0096 Argentine hockey player Gonzalo Peillat tweaks his hip movements and shifts body weight late when drag flicking to flummox goalies. In cricket, Zaheer Khan and James Anderson tweaked the grips slightly differently for their oh-so-slow knuckle balls, and football has its Panenka dinks \u0096 even if Master Pirlo is gone. Birmingham had Tai Tzu Ying as winner last Sunday, when badminton\u0092s sorcery came alive.
