Part two of a three-part series on changes to the college admissions process. Read part one, which describes a new focus on authentic community service, here.\r\n\r\nThe world needs young adults who are ethically aware, connected to their communities, and ready to dig into the problems threatening the common good. But today's college admissions process, which can consume teenagers and dictate what they do and value, instead encourages a competitive focus on personal successes and accolades. Colleges admissions do endorse community service, but too often, service commitments become sidelined, trumped up, or perfunctory.\r\n\r\nA growing consortium of key stakeholders wants to change that dynamic, joining an effort to reform the college admissions process so it prioritizes concern for others and authentic community engagement. Those goals are part of a new approach to admissions outlined in Turning the Tide, a report from the Harvard Graduate School of Education\u0092s Making Caring Common (MCC) initiative that has now been endorsed by more than 140 colleges and universities, high schools and districts, and allied organizations and scholars.\r\n\r\nTo actually change the annual rituals of college admissions is a daunting challenge, since many of us have grown accustomed to the idea that the path to the perfect school means focusing intently on personal metrics. But the report offers a roadmap of practical steps that school counselors and college admissions officers can take to reframe the process. The advice centers on one key idea: The importance of intentional messaging that colleges will place a high value on authentic community engagement and contributions to others.\r\n\r\nFOR HIGH SCHOOL COUNSELORS\r\nFor high school counselors, already the primary coaches in the college search process, a report that elevates the value of personal commitments and authentic connection can help lead students in the right direction.\r\n\r\n\u0093It\u0092s a great tool to have as a counselor, because I can point to it and say this Turning the Tide report suggests that colleges want to see that you\u0092re engaging in authentic service,\u0094 explains Sarah Style, a guidance counselor at Newton South High School in Massachusetts. \u0093It gives us an opportunity to say, this is what authentic service means, and this is what it doesn\u0092t mean.\u0094\r\n\r\nHere\u0092s what that can look like in practice. First, counselors can nudge students to expand their understanding of service; rather than framing it as \u0093doing for,\u0094 counselors can help students see it as \u0093doing with.\u0094 To prompt them to find meaningful opportunities, counselors can:\r\n\r\nStress service that is local, skill-building, and emotionally and ethically engaging. Counselors should make it clear that it doesn\u0092t matter to colleges if service occurs in some far-off land or whether the students were leaders. Much more important is that it is an immersive experience that aids communities and helps the student develop skills and ethical awareness.\r\nRemind students with significant family responsibilities, such as working to support their families, to include those contributions on their applications. These responsibilities demonstrate the same \u0097 if not greater \u0097 commitment and caring as community service, but if the colleges don\u0092t explicitly ask, students may be unsure whether to include them.\r\nCommunicate to students that admissions officers are alert to service that is inauthentic or trumped up. Students should be honest on their applications about how much time they really spent on a project, what its impact was, and what they learned from it. Most college admissions officers will detect it if they\u0092re not honest.\r\nContinue to emphasize the importance of a challenging course load and good grades. Says Style, \u0093I would never say to lie to a student and say, \u0091Don\u0092t worry about taking difficult classes because schools aren\u0092t going to care about that.\u0092 I do think they\u0092re going to care. Colleges want to admit students who are going to be successful in their institution, and I think one of the signs of that is they\u0092ve been successful academically.\u0094\r\nFOR COLLEGE ADMISSIONS OFFICERS\r\nChanging college admissions is a two-way street. Beyond the work that high schools do, colleges will have to indicate to applicants the value their institution places on community service and ethical development \u0097 and what exactly service means to them.\r\n\r\nTo do that, college admissions officers can:\r\n\r\nInclude explicit opportunities on applications for teenagers to write about community service engagements or significant family responsibilities. Some students won\u0092t explain a service commitment if they aren\u0092t given the space to do so. Applications should also give examples of what students can include in this section. Students may not understand that caring for younger siblings or working on an anti-bullying campaign counts as authentic service.\r\nLook critically at how service has impacted students. Admissions officers should use these written responses to assess how service has helped students become more cognizant of their strengths and weaknesses, deepen their understanding of communities different from their own, or develop a passion for social justice. \r\nAsk recommenders to consider how students work with diverse groups. Along with asking teachers and coaches about students\u0092 intellectual engagement, growth, and leadership, colleges can ask them to comment on how well students collaborated with people of different backgrounds or perspectives, and how those teamwork skills grew over time.\r\nConsider the messages imparted through admissions materials. At the University of Washington, for example, the school\u0092s key value is contribution to the common good, says Phillip Ballinger, the associate vice provost for enrollment and undergraduate admissions. \u0093And if that\u0092s not being perceived by families and parents, then we need to make some efforts to change that,\u0094 he says. \u0093That\u0092s on us to think now about making a very specific effort to actively seek students who notably stand out as people of the community in terms of their service, their connection to others, or even in a quiet way in terms of their family.\u0094
