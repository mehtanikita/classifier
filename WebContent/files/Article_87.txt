Manchester City midfielder Kevin De Bruyne believes the Premier League side can reach this season\u0092s Champions League final as they head into Wednesday\u0092s last-16 second leg at AS Monaco with a 5-3 lead.City, who have struggled to translate their domestic success on to the European stage in recent years, were eliminated in the semi-finals by Real Madrid last year but De Bruyne is hoping to go at least one step further this term.\u0093I think we can reach the final, but of course the other teams will think the same. And that doesn\u0092t make it easier,\u0094 the 25-year-old told British media.\u0093It will be very tough against Monaco, they are doing extremely well at the moment, but we are very positive and if we beat them we are through to the quarter-finals, after which the final is not that far away.\u0094De Bruyne also felt that City must improve their performances in high-pressure games if they hope to be fighting for some of the most prestigious trophies on a regular basis.\u0093I think it was important as a team to make the next step. City have had a difficult time in Europe, which is new for this club, but last year we did great in the Champions League,\u0094 the Belgian added.\u0093When you play at the highest level, you\u0092re always playing in big matches whether it\u0092s in the Premier League, the cups, the Champions League or at international level.\u0094
