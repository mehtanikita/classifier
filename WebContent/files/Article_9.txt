\u0093Maybe it\u0092s because I\u0092m white, but I\u0092m feeling like \u0091all lives matter,\u0092\u0094 Tiffany told our class during a discussion of diversity. She was a student in a Stanford course I taught last spring, \u0093Making Peace in Ourselves and in the World.\u0094\r\nBefore the next class, Shirley, a leader of the Black Lives Matter group on campus, apologetically told me she wouldn\u0092t be coming. \u0093I don\u0092t want to share my story with her,\u0094 she explained. I knew that we had a lot of work to do.\r\n\r\nAnd we\u0092re not alone. The violent events that birthed the Black Lives Matter movement ignited internal anguish and social action in many students; in others, they raised fears of division and separateness. Students across the nation have been speaking out not only on issues of racial justice but also about sexual violence, demanding that universities become more just and equitable societies. Campus administrators, faculty, and students have been struggling to figure out how to foster feelings of inclusion, reduce marginalization, and create an educational environment that feels safe and accepting for all students.\r\nThere are many ways to address these issues. My own approach has been guided by a wealth of research, including a review of more than 500 studies, suggesting that when people of different races and ethnicities get to know each other, the effect is generally positive.\r\nI created several new courses informed by this research, also drawing on research-backed principles of mindfulness and compassion, revising a model I had originally developed for trainings with the U.S. Marines and Navy.\r\nDid it work? By the final meeting of the class this past spring, not only had Shirley returned to our class but she and Tiffany shared an embrace. Tiffany wrote:\r\nWhat happens in this class is a kind of tiny miracle. We cross borders, inside ourselves and between us and others, finding the connections that we hunger for and realize that\u0092s what we need to keep going. We\u0092re filled with gratitude for each other and just for being here.\r\n\r\nHow did we achieve this \u0093tiny miracle\u0094? Here are what I see as the key steps to creating an environment on campus where students can \u0093cross borders\u0094 and reach a place of genuine understanding and connection. I believe these principles are relevant to any classes or other on-campus forums aimed at fostering inclusion and positive cross-group relationships; I hope instructors for other courses also consider how to incorporate some of these principles into their work.
