The idea of \u0093learning math\u0094 often conjures the image of a student hunched over his desk, solving problems using a set formula he copied down from his teacher. Math, we tend to think, is a strict set of algorithms, practices, and rules \u0097 all emanating from inside the classroom. New resources from the Harvard Family Research Project (HFRP), though, paint a different picture entirely \u0097 elevating the role of the family as a source of math knowledge.\r\n\r\nIn its latest initiative, HFRP is focusing on the idea that children\u0092s knowledge of math is \u0093broad and deep,\u0094 developing anywhere, anytime, and even starting at birth. Families are instrumental to their children's success in mathematics, as they can help children recognize and use mathematical thinking in everyday activities.\r\n\r\nBut today's math assignments can be confounding for parents who learned math in a pre-Common Core era, or in a different country \u0097 or who still harbor math anxiety from their own days at school, or never fully learned to connect the dots between everyday actions and math lessons. To ensure students are ready to thrive, educators have to partner with parents, acknowledging how diverse families already use math \u0097 and how they understand and grapple with math in their own ways.\r\n\r\nMATH IS CULTURAL\r\nTo start, educators should keep in mind three broad ideas about mathematics and families, as explained by Diane Kinch and Marta Civil of the group TODOS: Mathematics for All.\r\n\r\nMathematics is cultural. Families, especially parents who went to school outside of the United States, may have learned math differently than the way their children are learning it. They may have indicated decimals with commas instead of periods, or relied more on mental math in long division \u0097 and they may become confused (or confuse their children) when not introduced to the methods taught in their children\u0092s school.\r\nMathematics exists in many different ways in many different communities. Research often concludes that lower-income homes don\u0092t do as many math activities as upper-income homes. But all families use math with their children, whether it\u0092s through halving a recipe, calculating gas mileage, or figuring out the right angle to shoot a basketball. It\u0092s up to teachers to connect with their school community and understand the practices and strengths of the families they work with. \r\nStudents learn best when their families and teachers are co-learners. Teachers should help cultivate the mindset that everyone has different beliefs about what\u0092s important in mathematics, and how that should be taught and learned.\r\nFIVE STRATEGIES FOR CONNECTING WITH FAMILIES\r\nHow exactly can educators connect with families about mathematics? HFRP offers specific suggestions, drawn from TODOS, the case study \u0093Daddy Says This New Math Is Crazy,\u0094 and the program Nana y Yo y las Mathematicas:\r\n\r\nLeverage parents\u0092 mathematical strengths. Seek out opportunities to identify math content and approaches with which parents are familiar. Look for and encourage instances of parents using math with their children, such as counting or noticing shapes, before asking parents to try out a new technique.\r\nMake communication with parents the focus of homework. It\u0092s easy for children and parents to grow frustrated when children can\u0092t remember how to do their homework, and parents don\u0092t understand the method that their children are supposed to use. Circumvent this problem by assigning students homework specifically asking them to teach the new method they learned that day to their parents.\r\nOrganize math discussions with families. Coordinate get-togethers to discuss content, ways to solve problems, and which skills are most important \u0097 meetings in which everyone is open to learning from each other.\r\nInvite parents into the classroom. Ask parents to speak to their class about times that they have used math in their everyday lives. To demonstrate how mathematics is different \u0097 and the same \u0097 across cultures, invite parents to teach the class a lesson using the methods they learned in school, or using the same methods, but in another language.\r\nCapture classroom lessons on video. Visits during the school day are not feasible for all families. Use smartphones to text short videos of lessons, to ensure parents feel included and aware of new learning methods.
