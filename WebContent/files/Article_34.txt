State funding of higher education isn\u0092t going where it\u0092s most needed, according to a new paper from education economist Bridget Terry Long. Highlighting the dramatic declines in state support and the disparities in what top public flagship universities and community colleges receive, Long shows that funding patterns follow students who are already likely to enroll and graduate, leaving higher-need students without the resources that would bolster their success.\r\n\r\nTo meet the national goal of developing a workforce that is majority college-educated, states will have to direct more funding to the nonselective four-year institutions and community colleges that serve the least academically prepared students \u0097 precisely those most at risk of dropping out.\r\n\r\nUNEQUAL SPENDING AFFECTS HIGH-NEED STUDENTS\r\nWhile FAFSA and federal aid programs often receives more attention, state appropriations to public colleges and universities are actually the most significant source of education funding in America. Instead of aiding individual students on a need-based system, state funding lowers the sticker price at public institutions for all students.\r\n\r\nBut those funds are not allocated evenly. Using data from the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System, Long, the academic dean at the Harvard Graduate School of Education, found that flagship universities and other four-year schools receive much more money per student than community colleges. In the 1990s in California, for instance, the state\u0092s flagship university, University of California\u0096Berkeley, received nine times more in state subsidies per student than community colleges did.\r\n\r\nResearch institutions generally do need more money than other colleges, to fund medical schools and other expensive STEM programs. But these different schools also end up educating very different students. White, affluent students are more likely to attend flagship schools, while their lower-income, black, Latino, and first-generation peers are more likely to attend community colleges. Higher SAT scores also correlate with higher state funding.\r\n\r\nThe result, writes Long, is a higher education system that allocates \u0093the smallest state subsidies to our most vulnerable students \u0097 students who might benefit greatly from additional resources used to bolster their persistence and likelihood of degree completion.\u0094 Students attending community colleges receive less financial aid and enjoy fewer academic and social opportunities and resources, all of which makes them less likely to graduate \u0097 perpetuating an inequitable system of educational attainment.\r\n\r\nFOUR POLICY FIXES TO EXPAND ACCESS, COMPLETION\r\nWhile it\u0092s clear that high-need students require more financial assistance, the issue isn\u0092t quite so simple. In the past 25 years, state funding for higher education has dropped across the board, making a college degree a greater financial burden for all students. From 1988 to 2013, flagship universities across the United States saw a 52 percent decrease, and community colleges a 42 percent decrease, in the proportion of state funding they received. So while the gap in state funding between four-year and two-year colleges has narrowed slightly, prices have gone up significantly for all students \u0097 which inevitably hits the hardest for low-income students.\r\n\r\nBecause growing evidence links a school\u0092s resources to student outcomes, simply redistributing funding so that flagship universities receive less isn\u0092t the answer. Instead, Long has four suggestions for policymakers to make college more financially accessible to all students, and increase graduation rates nationwide:\r\n\r\nStates do need to reallocate higher education aid \u0093with greater awareness of the repercussions of funding patterns,\u0094 writes Long. But states will have to increase funding at all schools to ensure that all students are equipped for success.  \r\nStates could also target financial aid directly at students, offering more need-based grants and loans, rather than giving it to schools as operational subsidies. In this approach, the government is more intentional about helping the state\u0092s neediest students enroll and graduate, instead of giving all students the same amount of aid regardless of financial need.\r\nIf states do give money directly to schools, then they can still focus on using those funds to improve student outcomes. \u0093Funding should be geared toward institutional efforts to help at-risk students make progress towards their degrees,\u0094 writes Long.\r\nLastly, the fact that the White House has set a goal of increasing the number of post-secondary degrees nationwide \u0093may justify a stronger federal role\u0094 in public higher education. The federal government may have to provide aid to colleges serving high-risk students in order to improve educational equity, especially in instances where state funds are declining dramatically.
