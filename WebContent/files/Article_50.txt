Washington D.C. [USA], Apr 14 (ANI): Scientists have developed a revolutionary 3D-bioprinted patch that could one day be used to repair damage to the human heart.\r\n\r\nThe patch can help heal scarred heart tissue after a heart attack. The discovery is a major step forward in treating patients with tissue damage after a heart attack.\r\n\r\nThe researchers from the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities, University of Wisconsin-Madison, and University of Alabama-Birmingham used laser-based 3D-bioprinting techniques to incorporate stem cells derived from adult human heart cells on a matrix that began to grow and beat synchronously in a dish in the lab.\r\n\r\nWhen the cell patch was placed on a mouse following a simulated heart attack, the researchers saw significant increase in functional capacity after just four weeks. Since the patch was made from cells and structural proteins native to the heart, it became part of the heart and absorbed into the body, requiring no further surgeries.\r\n\r\n\"This is a significant step forward in treating the No. 1 cause of death in the U.S.,\" said researcher Brenda Ogle. \"We feel that we could scale this up to repair hearts of larger animals and possibly even humans within the next several years.\"\r\n\r\nOgle said that this research is different from previous research in that the patch is modelled after a digital, three-dimensional scan of the structural proteins of native heart tissue. The digital model is made into a physical structure by 3D printing with proteins native to the heart and further integrating cardiac cell types derived from stem cells. Only with 3D printing of this type can we achieve one micron resolution needed to mimic structures of native heart tissue.\r\n\r\n\"We were quite surprised by how well it worked given the complexity of the heart,\" Ogle noted. \"We were encouraged to see that the cells had aligned in the scaffold and showed a continuous wave of electrical signal that moved across the patch.\"\r\n\r\nOgle said they are already beginning the next step to develop a larger patch that they would test on a pig heart, which is similar in size to a human heart.\r\n\r\nThe research study is published in Circulation Research, a journal published by the American Heart Association.
