Even as various reform efforts have sought to address the inequities of educational outcomes in the United States \u0097 leading to some improvements in specific areas \u0097 deep and persistent gaps in opportunity and achievement remain.\r\n\r\nCan schools alone close those gaps? The blunt answer, according to Professor Paul Reville and the Education Redesign Lab, is no. So what\u0092s next? What are the resources and partnerships schools need to make sure that every child has a chance to succeed?\r\n\r\nIn teaming up with superintendents and mayors from six cities (Louisville, Kentucky; Oakland, California; Providence, Rhode Island; and Newton, Salem, and Somerville, Massachusetts), the Education Redesign Lab is looking for specific, research-based answers to those questions. The multi-year initiative, called By All Means: Redesigning Education to Restore Opportunity, aims to create comprehensive and linked systems for learning and wellbeing that help eliminate what Reville calls the \u0093iron-law\u0094 connection between socioeconomic status and achievement.\r\n\r\nThis week, By All Means hosted the first of a planned series of national convenings to dig into these unrelenting inequities and share strategies to address them. Mayors from the six cities, along with education leaders from across the country, came together to start the process of rethinking local systems to better serve all students.\r\n\r\nHere, Usable Knowledge provides a series of snapshots from their conversations, revealing the complexity of educational inequality at the local level.\r\n\r\nSCHOOLS CAN PLAY A ROLE . . .\r\nOne thing is clear: Schools can implement certain research-based initiatives to help even the most disadvantaged students succeed.\r\n\r\nFive specific whole-school practices have been shown to boost test scores and increase graduation rates, according to Professor Roland Fryer. One strand of his research, which has sought to replicate effective charter-school practices in public school contexts, has shown that when a school increases instructional time, has excellent teachers and administrators, and instills data-driven instruction, small-group tutoring, and a culture of high expectations, it can eliminate gaps in math performance.\r\n\r\nIncorporating noncognitive skills into the school day can give students their own tools for lifelong success. Many low-income children, who are under significant stress, don\u0092t develop the self-regulation and planning skills needed for academic achievement. Turnaround for Children is working to help educators build those social-emotional skills into curricula from elementary school through high school, said CEO Pamela Cantor.\r\n\r\nSchools can also provide parents with the resources they need to be involved. Tiffany Anderson, the superintendent of Jennings Public Schools in Missouri, cited a program that put washers and dryers and a food bank into Jennings schools in order to help families with their basic needs \u0097 and to make it easier for them to attend PTO meetings.\r\n\r\nFinally, schools can set students on a road to success after they graduate. Richard Barth, the CEO of the KIPP Foundation, described an effective initiative at KIPP charter schools to guide students to apply to more \u0093target\u0094 colleges where they will thrive academically, be supported socially, and receive the necessary financial aid.\r\n\r\nBUT COMMUNITIES MUST COLLABORATE . . .\r\nBut as Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf explained, no single K-12 system can close the achievement gap on its own.\r\n\r\nTo give every child a real chance at the social freedom and economic mobility promised by the American dream, schools have to partner with their communities. In the words of Somerville Mayor Joseph Curtatone, \u0093we have to understand community as a complex ecosystem\u0094 \u0097 one where the parts work together to achieve common goals. Curtatone cited Shape Up Somerville as a successful city initiative that achieved an ambitious goal \u0097 reducing childhood obesity \u0097 by partnering with all aspects of the community, including schools, local restaurants, farmers\u0092 markets, and transportation.\r\n\r\nTo start seeding those connections, \u0093build off of what you have,\u0094 said Providence Mayor Jorge Elorza. If a city has great after-school programs, for instance, then a school district looking for summer-learning options can begin by reaching out to those organizations to put together summer programs.\r\n\r\nNotably, organizations don\u0092t have to be education-focused to be involved. Businesses should recognize that success in their local schools will benefit them, eventually giving them better-trained employees or a populace with the resources to spend more, said Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer. Museums can bring students in for field trips. Business leaders can set up youth job opportunities for teenagers. And any adult in the community can donate her time to tutor children. Mayors need to make the case to their communities that these connections matter.\r\n\r\nCities also need to recognize that education doesn\u0092t end with the school day, or even at graduation. Working with families is the \u0093next frontier in education,\u0094 said Newton Mayor Setti Warren.\r\n\r\nIn Jennings, for example, the town begins working with families from birth so that children enter school with the non-cognitive and academic tools to succeed. And the Providence Talks initiative is working to close the \u0093word gap\u0094 that separates kindergarteners from low- and high-income families by empowering parents to talk more with their young children and take an active role in those children\u0092s education from the start.\r\n\r\nFinally, cities need to build human capital to maintain these partnerships. In order to make sure that everyone is working toward the same goal, \u0093we have to have people that are responsible for the connections themselves, [people who] own the network\u0094 between schools and their communities, said Elorza.\r\n\r\nAND EXPECT TO MEET OPPOSITION\r\nThis type of a full-scale effort \u0097 whether it\u0092s reforming education within schools or concentrating an entire community on its children\u0092s wellbeing \u0097 will have to overcome opposition. These initiatives will be big, complicated, a departure from \"business as usual,\" and potentially expensive, at least in the short term.\r\n\r\nTo gain trust, reformers need to communicate how big this problem is \u0097 and how much these reforms could pay off in the long run. Citing the so-called school-to-prison pipeline, Fischer said that some communities are paying tens of thousands of dollars to incarcerate young men and women who entered school in kindergarten already at a social, economic, and academic disadvantage. Paying for universal pre-K is much less expensive than paying for prison, he said, and reformers have to make that case.\r\n\r\n\u0093We have to communicate the why\u0094 to education reforms, said Salem Mayor Kimberley Driscoll. \u0093We have to explain that students never get a second change to be in third grade.\u0094\r\n\r\nReformers also need to engage constituents early in the process, and explain how educational change could eventually make their lives and their jobs easier, said Elorza.\r\n\r\nEventually, gaining support comes down to the individual will of every community member. \u0093This problem is not insurmountable,\u0094 said Fryer; though he said that political will is not growing fast enough. \u0093The question we have to ask ourselves is, \u0091Do we really want to solve this problem?\u0092\u0094 And \u0093the question to voters is, \u0091Will we hold people in office accountable? Are we willing to do what we should do for kids who are not ours and who may not look like ours?\u0092\u0094
