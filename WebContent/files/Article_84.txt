India coach Anil Kumble on Tuesday said there was no need for his team to curb its aggression despite the din over on-field behaviour in what is turning out to be an intensely-fought Test series against Australia.\u0093I don\u0092t want to curb any natural instinct of the players as long as they go out there and do what is expected of them. I don\u0092t think we need to read too much into the aggression. Every player has his own way of having a game face,\u0094 Kumble said ahead of the third Test.The big-ticket series is poised at 1-1, with everything to play for in the remaining two matches.On aggression, Kumble added, \u0093And that\u0092s what you want. You want everyone to go out there and show what they are capable of. This is a very important series. It\u0092s 1-1. Both teams will come hard in this game. I\u0092m sure cricket will be the winner.\u0094The DRS controversy surrounding Steve Smith\u0092s dismissal threatened to overshadow India\u0092s fightback, eventually prompting BCCI and Cricket Australia to issue a joint statement to bring the matter to an end.\u0093As custodians of this great game, we believe it\u0092s important that we look after the game. Key stakeholders are the players and they certainly understand their responsibility,\u0094 the former India captain told reporters.Kumble lauded the BCCI for taking a \u0093matured call\u0094 and bring the focus back to cricket.\u0093I think what was important was to focus back on the game. I am very glad the BCCI took a very matured call with Cricket Australia and issued a joint statement that cricket needs to move on and moved out from whatever happened in Bangalore.\u0093That I think is important because focus has to be on the game. I thought we made a really fantastic comeback after losing the first Test. It was very rewarding,\u0094 he said.Asked if Smith and Virat Kohli would meet before the town\u0092s maiden Test, Kumble responded in positive.\u0093Yes they will meet.\u0094Kumble said the team was not affected by the talks around DRS and pitches used in the two Test.\u0093It doesn\u0092t affect our game. We only want to play. We are not doing the talking but you are. We are just playing and thinking about the game on the field,\u0094 the coach said.Going back to the second Test, Kumble said the host nation showed character.\u0093I think Day 2 (of Bangalore Test) was fantastic. There was attrition. Only 190 runs were scored and six wickets were taken but the intensity and control with which our bowlers bowled, especially the pacers, showed character. That\u0092s what you want to see in a team \u0096 a lot of character and pride in doing things and coming back and winning a Test match.\u0093What stood out for me was KL Rahul\u0092s batting in both innings in Bangalore and the partnership between Cheteshwar Pujara and Ajinkya Rahane. If you look at the series so far we haven\u0092t had a wicket-less session. But we scored more than 90 runs in that session without losing a wicket. That was a defining moment.\u0094The spin legend patted his boys and said they responded well since he took over the reins.\u0093It\u0092s good we are playing so well consistently. From the West Indies series there have been many milestones. We have won all series. Virat Kohli has hit four double hundreds, (Ravichandran) Ashwin is the fastest to reach to 250 wickets.\u0093The boys responded well. Not easy to play such a long season. (Mohammed) Shami is injured. We have had some injuries. If you are performing at home it helps. It\u0092s not as if one individual has played. We would want to finish last two Tests in a good way. We hope for a result.\u0094Kumble showered praise on Umesh Yadav, saying the right-arm pacer always looks to pick up a five-wicket haul.\u0093The way Umesh has bowled, given breakthroughs, credit to him for the maturity he\u0092s shown. Every time he bowled he looked like getting a fifer. Happy for Ashwin but also glad how (Ravindra) Jadeja came up the rankings.\u0094The historic Test is to be played in Mahendra Singh Dhoni\u0092s home ground and when asked about the former captain, Kumble said, \u0093Without MS it might look different. I know he is playing for Jharkhand but I hope he can make it some day. I hope Ranchi people come to support us in what is a historic moment.\u0094
