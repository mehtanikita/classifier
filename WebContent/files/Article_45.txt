There were startling colors here just a year ago, a dazzling array of life beneath the waves. Now this Maldivian reef is dead, killed by the stress of rising ocean temperatures.\r\n\r\nWhat\u0092s left is a haunting expanse of gray, a scene repeated in reefs across the globe in what has fast become a full\u0097blown ecological catastrophe.\r\n\r\nThe world has lost roughly half its coral reefs in the last 30 years. Scientists are now scrambling to ensure that at least a fraction of these unique ecosystems survives beyond the next three decades. The health of the planet depends on it: Coral reefs support a quarter of all marine species, as well as half a billion people around the world.\r\n\r\n\u0093This isn\u0092t something that\u0092s going to happen 100 years from now. We\u0092re losing them right now,\u0094 said marine biologist Julia Baum of Canada\u0092s University of Victoria. \u0093We\u0092re losing them really quickly, much more quickly than I think any of us ever could have imagined.\u0094\r\n\r\nEven if the world could halt global warming now, scientists still expect that more than 90 per cent of corals will die by 2050. Without drastic intervention, we risk losing them all.\r\n\r\n\u0093To lose coral reefs is to fundamentally undermine the health of a very large proportion of the human race,\u0094 said Ruth Gates, director of the Hawaii Institute of Marine Biology.\r\n\r\nCoral reefs produce some of the oxygen we breathe. Often described as underwater rainforests, they populate a tiny fraction of the ocean but provide habitats for one in four marine species. Reefs also form crucial barriers protecting coastlines from the full force of storms.\r\n\r\nThey provide billions of dollars in revenue from tourism, fishing and other commerce, and are used in medical research for cures to diseases including cancer, arthritis and bacterial or viral infections.\r\n\r\n\u0093Whether you\u0092re living in North America or Europe or Australia, you should be concerned,\u0094 said biologist Ove Hoegh-Guldberg, director of the Global Change Institute at Australia\u0092s University of Queensland. \u0093This is not just some distant dive destination, a holiday destination. This is the fabric of the ecosystem that supports us.\u0094 And that fabric is being torn apart.\r\n\r\n\u0093You couldn\u0092t be more dumb ... to erode the very thing that life depends on the ecosystem and hope that you\u0092ll get away with it,\u0094 Hoegh-Guldberg said.\r\n\r\nCorals are invertebrates, living mostly in tropical waters. They secrete calcium carbonate to build protective skeletons that grow and take on impressive colors, thanks to a symbiotic relationship with algae that live in their tissues and provide them with energy.\r\n\r\nBut corals are sensitive to temperature fluctuations, and are suffering from rising ocean temperatures and acidification, as well as from overfishing, pollution, coastal development and agricultural runoff.
