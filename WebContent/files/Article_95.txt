American Bobby Wood had another game to remember on Sunday, scoring a late winner after his earlier goal was disallowed as Hamburger SV beat Borussia Moenchengladbach 2-1 to boost its Bundesliga survival chances.The 24-year-old Wood is steadily making a name for himself since joining Hamburg from German second-division team Union Berlin last summer. He struck with 10 minutes remaining when he left defender Jannik Vestergaard sprawling with a quick change of feet and then rifled the ball into the roof of the net from close range.It was Wood\u0092s fifth league goal of the season. The Hawaii-born forward has eight goals in 29 appearances for the US national team.\u0091Gladbach defender Andreas Christensen had opened the scoring after 20 minutes with a header off Oscar Wendt\u0092s free kick.Wood thought he\u0092d equalized seven minutes later but the goal was ruled out for offside amid Hamburg protests after the linesman at first failed to raise his flag.The linesman further antagonized home fans with another offside decision ruling out Lewis Holtby\u0092s lob over Yann Sommer. TV replays showed it was again the correct call.But there was nothing wrong with Filip Kostic\u0092s header in off the post a minute later in the 36th, sparking relieved celebrations for Hamburg and prompting a wry smile from referee Deniz Aytekin with all the players looking in his direction.Hamburg \u0091keeper Rene Adler pulled off two huge saves to deny Josip Drmic and then Patrick Herrmann in the first half.Hamburg had the ball in the net again in the second, and once more it was ruled out for offside, leaving Kyriakos Papadopoulos with his hands on his face. Again, it was the right call.Knowing that a win would draw the side level on points with relegation-rivals Wolfsburg and Werder Bremen, Hamburg kept pushing for the winner until Wood proved the hero.Hamburg remains in the relegation zone but only on goal difference. Ten rounds remain.\u0093We should keep our focus, stay calm, humble. Then we\u0092ll manage it and get the points we need,\u0094 Hamburg coach Markus Gisdol said.SCHALKE 3, AUGSBURG 0Guido Burgstaller scored twice as Schalke ended its three-game winless run in the league with a comfortable 3-0 victory over Augsburg.Winter signing Burgstaller got the home side off to a flying start in the fourth minute and claimed his second in the 29th.The normally reliable Paul Verhaegh then missed a penalty for Augsburg before Daniel Caligiuri scored at the other end.The visitors\u0092 poor afternoon continued when striker Raul Bobadilla had to go off with an injury sustained in the challenge from Benedikt Hoewedes that led to the penalty.The second half proved just a formality. Max Meyer might have made it 4-0 before Hoewedes missed another good chance for the home side.\u0093We lost the game in the first 45 minutes,\u0094 Augsburg coach Manuel Baum said.Schalke jumped two points above Augsburg into 11th place, while the visitors were just two points above the relegation zone after Hamburg\u0092s win in the late game.
