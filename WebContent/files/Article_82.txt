It was an early morning in May, 2015. The sun was yet to rise. A cold breeze from the south wafted over us. We were sitting on a giant rock on one of the highest mountains of the Western Ghats\u0097the Camel\u0092s Hump mountain\u0097overlooking the dark valley of Nilambur, waiting to catch the sunrise. And as we gazed east, the rays emerged from behind the giant peaks.\r\n\r\nThe silence was suddenly broken by a long musical call from a Sholakili from a bush, and the fluttering of a flock of mountain babblers. A giant white cloud appeared out of nowhere and gradually occupied the vacant valleys. Quite soon, the entire valley became a white ocean. Only a few mountain peaks emerged out of this vast swathe like islands, islands in the sky\u0097the \u0091sky islands\u0092 of the Western Ghats\u0097an extraordinary ecosystem that has always fascinated evolutionary biologists.\r\n\r\nMountaintops separated from each other by deep valleys are indeed much like islands of the ocean in terms of evolutionary processes because of their isolation. These mountains were formed during the uplift of the Western Ghats, starting around 150 million years ago, where the high-elevation montane habitat, the shola (a mosaic of forest and grasslands), evolved. In fact, they are cradles of evolution. The formation of species here occurred over millennia, dictated by the geographic and climatic isolation of these mountain tops. And so what we have today is high endemism, that is, a concentration of species\u0097birds, frogs, plants, and fish\u0097that are found nowhere else in the world.\r\n\r\nTo a scientist, mountain habitats are also natural laboratories where one can study behavioural and evolutionary changes in response to climatic and human-made pressures.\r\n\r\nAdapting to new ways\r\n\r\n\r\nLife forms have adapted to these sky islands much like they would to oceanic islands. Each sky island is home to distinct species. Among birds, we see huge differences\u0097morphological and acoustic\u0097in these islands.\r\n\r\n
